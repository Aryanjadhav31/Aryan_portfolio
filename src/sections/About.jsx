I am a Computer Science & Engineering student at Rajarambapu Institute of Technology, driven by the genuine enjoyment of building secure, production-ready software rather than simply completing requirements. My primary focus areas are backend systems, APIs, databases, and full-stack applications, which is where conceptual ideas are successfully engineered into tangible products. Complementing this development focus, I prioritize cybersecurity, viewing the study of exploitation techniques as a crucial step toward building robust, well-defended, and resilient technical systems.  </p>

My approach to skill development is intensely practical, moving beyond pure theory and embracing a "figure it out by doing" mindset through hands-on work. I thrive in team environments, actively leading clubs and participating in hackathons, convinced that skills are magnified and accelerated when shared with peers who possess similar enthusiasm. This collaborative experience has instilled essential non-technical qualities such as patience, effective communication, and the responsibility required to ship functional work, even when perfection is out of reach.  </p>

The driving force behind my creativity and perspective is cinema, which acts as the core of my personal life and inspiration. I connect deeply with diverse genres, from raw love stories that capture complex human emotions to strategic, high-stakes spy and war thrillers. These stories offer an authentic lens on reality, spanning individual psychological depth to global conflict strategy. My ultimate goal is to translate this authentic perspective into my own work, ensuring that my technical and creative output feels real and resonates deeply with everyone who interacts with it.  </p>
