            I’m a Computer Engineering student who builds software like it’s craft—clean, strong, and occasionally held together by hope and stack overflow.
            AI is my curiosity engine, Cybersecurity is my adrenaline sport, Web Dev is my stage, and Backend is my home where APIs obey me (mostly).
            DSA and I are in a committed long-distance relationship—complicated, time-consuming, but character building.
            I architect systems to scale, tweak databases like pets with temper, and turn logic into solutions that work outside my dreams too.
            Beyond screens, I lead clubs, hack for learning, and enjoy teamwork more than semicolons.
            When I need a break, I debug myself on the cricket pitch—cover drives, not cover letters.
            Learning, building, improving, and smiling through errors—still undefeated.
